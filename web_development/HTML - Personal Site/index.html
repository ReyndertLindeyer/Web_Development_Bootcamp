        <p><em>Junior Programmer</em></p>

        <a href="ContactInfo.html">Contact Information</a>

        <p>I am a programmer who has been learning one language or another for the past five years, I started with Java but am now code mostly in C# and C++. <br>
          Over my education at Humber College I have created several small games as well as various C++ math libraries in my math classes.</p>

        <p>Over my time at Humber I've also learned how to use both Unity and Unreal with my Capstone having been coded in Unreal using almost exclusively C++. </p>

        <p>Below are my two Github repositories, the Eugenides repository is an older one of mine that has a few small school projects on it as well as a <br>
          Game Jam game. The ReyndertLindeyer repository was made for my capstone as I wanted an official student account for the project.</p>
